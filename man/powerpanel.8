.TH POWERPANEL 8 "Sat Mar 8 2008" "" "Network UPS Tools (NUT)"
.SH NAME
powerpanel \- Driver for PowerPanel Plus compatible UPS equipment
.SH NOTE
This man page only documents the hardware\(hyspecific features of the
powerpanel driver.  For information about the core driver, see
\fBnutupsdrv\fR(8).

.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
This driver supports CyberPower BC1200, PR2200 and many other similar
devices, both for the text and binary protocols. The driver will
autodetect which protocol is used.

.SH EXTRA ARGUMENTS
This driver supports the following optional settings in \fBups.conf\fR(5):

.IP "protocol=\fI[text,binary]\fR"
Override the default autodetection of the protocol.

.IP "manufacturer=\fIvalue\fR"
If you don't like the autodetected value, you can override this by setting
it here.

.IP "model=\fIvalue\fR"
Like manufacturer above.

.IP "serial=\fIvalue\fR"
Like manufacturer above.

.IP "ondelay=\fIvalue\fR"
Time to wait before switching on the UPS (1 - 9999 minutes, 0 indefinite).
Not available with the binary protocol.

.IP "offdelay=\fIvalue\fR"
Time to wait before shutting down the UPS (0 - 99 minutes). Some units only
support delay value up to 10 minutes. Not available with the binary protocol.

.SH VARIABLES
Depending on the type of your UPS unit, some of the following variables may
be changed. If the driver can't read a variable from the UPS, it will not be
made available.
.TP 12
.B input.transfer.high
writable: high transfer voltage point in V
.TP
.B input.transfer.low
writable: low transfer voltage point in V
.TP
.B battery.charge.low
writable: remaining battery charge percentage for low battery warning
.TP
.B output.voltage.nominal
writable: nominal output voltage in V
.TP
.B ups.start.battery
writable: allow cold start from battery
.PD

.SH COMMANDS
Depending on the type of your UPS unit, some of the following commands may
be available.
.TP 12
.B test.failure.start, test.failure.stop
start/stop 20 second battery test.
.TP
.B beeper.enable, beeper.disable, beeper.toggle
enable, disable or toggle the panel beeper.
.TP
.B shutdown.reboot
shut down load immediately for ca. 1\(hy2 minutes.
.TP
.B shutdown.return
shut down load immediately and stay off until the mains power returns.
.TP
.B shutdown.stop
cancel pending shutdown.
.PD

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
The CyberPower OP series don't offer direct voltage, charge, frequency
and temperature readings. Instead, they will return a binary value
that needs conversion to the actual value.

The exact conversion needed is unknown at the time of this writing,
hence an estimation was made based om readings from actual devices.
This may (probably will) be off, possibly a lot. Unless you can tell
us the exact mapping between values from the UPS and actual readings,
don't bother to complain. We've done the best we can based on the
limited information available.

Remember, a UPS isn't a measuring instrument.
