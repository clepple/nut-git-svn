.SH NAME
genericups \- Driver for contact\(hyclosure UPS equipment

.SH NOTE
This man page only documents the specific features of the genericups 
driver.  For information about the core driver, see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8).

.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
This driver supports hardware from many different manufacturers as it only 
uses the very simplest of signaling schemes.  Contact closure refers to a 
kind of interface where basic high/low signals are provided to indicate 
status.  This kind of UPS can only report line power and battery status.

This means that you will only get the essentials in ups.status: OL, OB,
and LB.  Anything else requires a smarter UPS.

.SH CABLING
Cabling is different for every kind of UPS.  See the table below for 
information on what is known to work with a given UPS type.

.SH EXTRA ARGUMENTS
This driver supports the following settings in the \fBups.conf\fR(5):

.IP "upstype=\fItype\fR"

Required.  Configures the driver for a specific kind of UPS.  See the UPS 
Types section below for more information on which entries are available.

.IP "mfr=\fIstring\fR"

Optional.  The very nature of a generic UPS driver sometimes means that 
the stock manufacturer data has no relation to the actual hardware that is 
attached.  With the mfr setting, you can change the value that is seen by 
clients that monitor this UPS.

.IP "model=\fIstring\fR"

Optional.  This is like mfr above, but it overrides the model string 
instead.

.IP "serial=\fIstring\fR"

Optional.  This is like mfr above and intended to record the identification
string of the UPS. It is titled serial because usually this string is 
referred to as the serial number.

.IP "sdtime=\fIvalue\fR"

Optional.  The driver will sleep for this many seconds after setting the 
shutdown signal.  This is necessary for some hardware which requires a
sustained level to activate the shutdown sequence.

The default behavior of the driver is to exit immediately.  If this
doesn't reliably trigger a shutdown in your UPS hardware, use this
setting to give it more time to react.

Note: very large values for sdtime may create warnings from upsdrvctl if
it gets tired of waiting for the driver to return.

.SH CUSTOM CONFIGURATIONS

You may override the values for CP, OL, LB, and SD by defining them in
the \fBups.conf\fR after the upstype setting.

For example, to set the cable power to DTR and the low battery value to
DCD, it would look like this:

	CP = DTR

	LB = DCD

Recognized values for input lines are CTS, DCD, and RNG.  Recognized
values for output lines are DTR, RTS, and ST.  See below for more about
what these signals mean.

These values may be negated for active low signals.  That is, "LB=\-DCD"
recognizes a low battery condition when DCD is not held high.

.SH CONNECTION MONITORING

The connection between the UPS and the computer is usually not
detectable by the driver due the simple mode of communication.  In some
cases, the UPS or driver has the ability to loop back a signal from the
PC.  If your hardware supports this feature, you can enable it in the
driver by defining "CON" in ups.conf.  This works just like the options
in the custom configurations section.

If your UPS/cable presents a signal on DCD when everything is connected
properly, you'd use this setting:

	CON = DCD

When this feature is enabled, the driver will report errors in the
syslog if the signal is not present.  This will also be visible in upsd
and to clients as stale data.

.SH TYPE INFORMATION
The essence of a UPS definition in this driver is how it uses the serial 
lines that are available.  These are the abbreviations you will see below:

	OL \(hy On line (no power failure) (opposite of OB \(hy on battery)

 	LB \(hy Low battery

	SD \(hy Shutdown load

	CP \(hy Cable power (must be present for cable to have valid reading)

	CTS \(hy Clear to Send.  Received from the UPS.

	RTS \(hy Ready to Send.  Sent by the PC.

	DCD \(hy Data Carrier Detect.  Received from the UPS.

	RNG \(hy Ring indicate.  Received from the UPS.

	DTR \(hy Data Terminal Ready.  Sent by the PC.

	ST \(hy Send a BREAK on the transmit data line

A \- in front of a signal name (like \-RNG) means that the indicated 
condition is signaled with an active low signal.  For example, [LB=\-RNG] 
means the battery is low when the ring indicate line goes low, and that 
the battery is OK when that line is held high.

.SH SIMILAR MODELS

Many different UPS companies make models with similar interfaces.  The 
RUPS cable seems to be especially popular in the "power strip" variety of 
UPS found in office supply stores.  If your UPS works with an entry in the
table above, but the model or manufacturer information don't match,
don't despair.  You can fix that easily by using the mfr and model 
variables documented above in your \fBups.conf\fR(5).

.SH TESTING COMPATIBILITY

If your UPS isn't listed above, you can try going through the list until 
you find one that works.  There is a lot of cable and interface reuse in 
the UPS world, and you may find a match.

To do this, first make sure nothing important is plugged into the
outlets on the UPS, as you may inadvertently switch it off.  Definitely
make sure that the computer you're using is not plugged into that UPS.
Plug in something small like a lamp so you know when power is being
supplied to the outlets.

Now, you can either attempt to make an educated guess based on the
documentation your manufacturer has provided (if any), or just start
going down the list.  

Step 1

Pick a driver to try from the list (genericups \-h) and go to step 2.

Step 2

Start the driver with the type you want to try \(hy

        genericups \-x upstype=n /dev/port

Let upsd sync up (watch the syslog), and then run upsc to see what it
found.  If the STATUS is right (should be OL for on line), go to step 3,
otherwise go back to step 1.

Step 3

Disconnect the UPS from the wall/mains power.  This is easiest if you
have a switched outlet in between it and the wall, but you can also just
pull the plug to test.  The lamp should stay lit, and the status should
switch to "OB".  If the lamp went out or the status didn't go to "OB"
within about 15 seconds, go to step 1.  Otherwise, continue to step 4.

Step 4

At this point, we know that OL and OB work.  If nothing else beyond
this point works, you at least know what your OL/OB value should be.

Wait for the UPS to start complaining about a low battery.  Depending on
the size of your UPS battery and the lamp's bulb, this could take
awhile.  It should start complaining audibly at some point.  When this
happens, STATUS should show "OB LB" within 15 seconds.  If not, go to
step 1, otherwise continue to step 5.

Step 5

So far: OL works, OB works, and LB works.

With the UPS running on battery, run the genericups driver with the \-k
switch to shut it down.

        genericups \-x upstype=n \-k /dev/port

If the UPS turns off the lamp, you're done.  At this point, you have
verified that the shutdown sequence actually does what you want.  You
can start using the genericups driver with this type number for normal
operations.

You should use your findings to add a section to your ups.conf.
Here is a quick example:

        [myups]
                driver = genericups
                port = /dev/ttyS0
                upstype = 1

Change the port and upstype values to match your system.

.SH NEW SUPPORT

If the above testing sequence fails, you will probably need to create a 
new entry to support your hardware.  All UPS types are determined from the 
table in the genericups.h file in the source tree.

On a standard 9 pin serial port, there are 6 lines that are used as the 
standard "high/low" signal levels.  4 of them are incoming (to the PC, 
from the UPS), and the other 2 are outgoing (to the UPS, from the PC).  
The other 3 are the receive/transmit lines and the ground.

Be aware that many manufacturers remap pins within the cable.  If you have 
any doubts, a quick check with a multimeter should confirm whether the 
cable is straight\(hythrough or not.  Another thing to keep in mind is that 
some cables have electronics in them to do special things.  Some have 
resistors and transistors on board to change behavior depending on what's 
being supplied by the PC.

.SH SPECIFIC MODEL NOTES

These have been contributed by users of this driver.

The Centralion CL series may power down the load if the driver starts up 
with the UPS running on battery as the default line settings contain the 
shutdown sequence.  \(hy Neil Muller

The Tripp\(hyLite Internet Office 700 must be used with the black 73\(hy0844 
cable instead of the gray 73\(hy0743 cable.  This entry should work with any 
of their models with the Lan 2.2 interface \(hy see the sticker by the DB9 
connector on the UPS.  \(hy Stephen Brown

Type 5 should work with the Tripp\(hyLite Lan 2.1 interface and the 73\(hy0724 
cable.  This was tested with the OmniSmart 675 PNP on Red Hat 7.2.  \(hy Q 
Giese

Types 7 and 10 should both work with the PhoenixTec A1000.

.SH BUGS

There is no way to reliably detect a contact\(hyclosure UPS.  This means the 
driver will start up happily even if no UPS is detected.  It also means 
that if the connection between the UPS and computer is interrupted, you 
may not be able to sense this in software.

Most contact\(hyclosure UPSes will not power down the load if the line power 
is present.  This can create a race when using slave \fBupsmon\fR(8) 
systems.  See the \fBupsmon\fR(8) man page for more information.

The solution to both of these problems is to upgrade to a smart protocol 
UPS of some kind that allows detection and proper load cycling on command.
