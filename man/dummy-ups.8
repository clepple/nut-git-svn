.SH NAME
dummy-ups \- Driver for testing UPS software

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dummy-ups [\fIport\fB]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program looks like a standard UPS driver to \fBupsd\fR(8) and 
allows you to set any value for testing purposes.  It is interactive,
through upsrw command or equivalent graphical tool. It can be
configured, launch and used as any other real driver.

.SH ARGUMENTS
The port specify a definition file name for dummy-ups, located
in NUT "etc" directory (ie /etc/nut, /usr/local/ups/etc, ...).
This file, generally named something.dev, contains a list of all
valid data and associated values, and has the same format as an upsc
dump (<varname>: <value>), so you can easilly create definition
files from existing UPS.

With no arguments, dummy-ups will assume a port name of "null", and
will preload the following data:

.nf
	driver.name			= dummy-ups
	driver.version			= (varies)
	driver.version.internal	= (varies)
	ups.mfr				= Dummy Manufacturer
	ups.model 			= Dummy UPS
	ups.status			= OL
.fi

You can also add an entry in \fBups.conf\fR(5), and run multiple
instances if needed.

.SH INTERACTION

Once the driver is loaded, you can set any variables, except those
of the driver.* and server.* collections.

.SH BACKGROUND

This driver was written in an evening to replace the previous 
dummycons which required to work from a terminal to interact.

It is useful for NUT client development, and other testing purpose.

.SH BUGS

Instant commands are not yet supported, and data need value checking
enforcement, as well as boundaries or enumeration definition.
