.TH UPSC 8 "Mon Jan 22 2007" "" "Network UPS Tools (NUT)" 
.SH NAME
upsc \- example lightweight UPS client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B upsc \fIups\fB [\fIvariable\fB]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B upsc
is provided as a quick way to poll the status of a UPS server.  It can be
used inside shell scripts and other programs that need UPS data but don't
want to include the full interface.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP \fIups\fR
Display the status of that UPS.  The format for this option is
upsname[@hostname[:port]].  The default hostname is "localhost".

For example, "myups@mybox:1234" would poll a UPS called "myups" on a host
called "mybox", with \fBupsd\fR(8) running on port 1234.

.IP \fIvariable\fR
Display the value of this variable only.  By default, upsc retrieves
the list of variables from the server and then displays the value for
each.  This may be useful in shell scripts to save an additional pipe
into grep.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

upsc will either print a list of all supported variables and their values
on the UPS or an error message.  If you receive an error, make sure you
have specified a valid UPS on the command line, that \fBupsd\fR(8) is
really running on the other host and that no firewalls are blocking you.

.SH HISTORY

Earlier versions of this program used the \fBupsfetch\fR library and UDP
sockets to talk to upsd.  This version of upsc uses the new
\fBupsclient\fR library, which only talks TCP.  This is why \fBupsct\fR
no longer exists.
