.TH APCSMART 8 "Mon Sep 29 2003" "" "Network UPS Tools (NUT)" 
.SH NAME  
apcsmart \- Driver for American Power Conversion Smart Protocol UPS equipment
.SH NOTE
This man page only documents the hardware\(hyspecific features of the
apcsmart driver.  For information about the core driver, see  
\fBnutupsdrv\fR(8).

.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
apcsmart should recognize all recent APC models that use a serial
protocol at 2400 bps.  This is primarily the Smart\(hyUPS, Matrix\(hyUPS and
Back\(hyUPS Pro lines.

The driver attempts to support every bell and whistle of the APC
reporting interface, whether or not this is strictly sensible.

Some older hardware may only report a handful of variables.  This is
usually not a bug \(hy they just don't support anything else.

.SH CABLING

This driver expects to see a 940\(hy0024C cable or a clone by default.  You
can switch to the 940\(hy0095B dual\(hymode cable support with the cable=
definition described below.

If your 940\(hy0024C cable is broken or missing, use this diagram to build
a clone:

.SH EXTRA ARGUMENTS
This driver supports the following optional settings in the
\fBups.conf\fR(5):

.IP "cable=940\(hy0095B"
Configure the serial port for the APC 940\(hy0095B dual\(hymode cable.

.IP "sdtype=\fInum\fR"
Use shutdown type \fInum\fR, according to this table:

0: soft shutdown or powerdown, depending on battery status

1: soft shutdown followed by powerdown

2: instant power off

3: power off with grace period

4: 'force OB' hack method for CS 350

Modes 0 and 1 will power up the load when power returns.  Modes 2 and 3
will keep the load turned off when the power returns.

Mode 4 exploits an oddity in the CS 350 models since they only seem to
support the S command, but then only when running on battery.  As a
result, the driver will force the UPS to go on battery if necessary
before sending the shutdown command.  This ensures that the load gets
reset.

.SH BUGS
Some older APC UPS models return bogus data in the status register during
a front panel test.  This is usually detected and discarded, but some
other unexpected values have occasionally slipped through.

APC UPS models with both USB and serial ports require a power cycle when
switching from USB communication to serial, and perhaps vice versa.

was called newapc for a time and was renamed in the 1.5 series.
