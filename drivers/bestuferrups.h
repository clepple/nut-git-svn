/* 
   bestuferrups.h - model specific routines for Best Power Micro-Ferrups

   This module is a 40% rewritten mangle of the bestfort module by
   Grant, which is a 75% rewritten mangle of the bestups module by
   Russell.   It has no test battery command since my ME3100 does this
   by itself. (same as Grant's driver in this respect)

   Support for model RE added by Tim Thompson (7/22/04)
