/* 
   bestfcom.h - model specific routines for Best Power F-Command ups models

   This module is yet another rewritten mangle of the bestuferrups
   driver.  This driver was written in an attempt to consolidate
   the various Best Fortress/FERRUPS modules that support the
   'f'-command set and provide support for more of these models.

   Models tested with this new version:
   FortressII	LI720
   FERRUPS	FE2.1K
   FERRUPS	FE4.3K
   FERRUPS	FE18K
   FERRUPS	FD4.3K

   From bestuferrups.c :

   This module is a 40% rewritten mangle of the bestfort module by
   Grant, which is a 75% rewritten mangle of the bestups module by
   Russell.   It has no test battery command since my ME3100 does this
   by itself. (same as Grant's driver in this respect)
