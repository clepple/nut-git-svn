This document introduces Linux Hotplug NG script for NUT USB
driver (newhidups, bcmxcp_usb and tripplite_usb).

These are needed on Linux systems 2.6.14 and higher running
udev. This ensure that the right privileges are set on the
usb devices files (ie allowing nut user to read AND write
to the UPS device).

Usage
-----

- copy nut-usbups.rules to /etc/udev/

- copy nut-usbups.hotplug to /etc/hotplug.d/usb/
and make it executable with:
$ chmod a+x /etc/hotplug.d/usb/nut-usbups.hotplug

(Note: on some newer kernels, you may not need the file
nut-usbups.hotplug at all, in which case you can omit the second step
above).

You can then plug your UPS, and start NUT.

Note that the old style hotplug files, available in the
hotplug directory, are not needed anymore.

TODO
----
- add configure and Makefile rules for easier installation
