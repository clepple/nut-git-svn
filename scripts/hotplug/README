This document introduces Linux Hotplug script for NUT USB
drivers (usbhid-ups, bcmxcp_usb and tripplite_usb).

These are needed, on older Linux systems, to ensure the right
privileges are set on the usb files (ie allowing nut user to read AND
write to the UPS device).

Alternative
-----------

For newer 2.6 kernels with the udev mechanism, you should use the
scripts in scripts/udev instead of this one.

Installation
------------

For most users, these files will be automatically installed in
/etc/hotplug upon "make install", if that directory exists. You can
specify an alternate directory by ./configure --with-hotplug-dir=DIR.

Manual installation
-------------------
These scripts can be used with Linux 2.4 to 2.6.13. 

- possibly change libhidups to match NUT user
- copy libhidups and libhid.usermap to /etc/hotplug/usb/
- make libhidups executable with:
       chmod a+x /etc/hotplug/usb/libhidups
- call update-usb.usermap or equivalent if needed

You can then plug your UPS, and start NUT.
