This document introduces Linux Hotplug script for NUT USB
drivers (usbhid-ups, bcmxcp_usb and tripplite_usb).

These are needed, on older Linux systems, to ensure the right
privileges are set on the usb files (ie allowing nut user to
read AND write to the UPS device)

Usage
-----
These scripts are to be used with Linux 2.4 and higher

- possibly change libhidups to match NUT user
- copy libhidups and libhid.usermap to /etc/hotplug/usb/
- make libhidups executable with:
       chmod a+x /etc/hotplug/usb/libhidups
- call update-usb.usermap or equivalent if needed

You can then plug your UPS, and start NUT.

Alternative
-----------

For newer 2.6 kernels with the udev mechanism, try scripts/udev
instead of this one.

TODO
----
- improve these scripts (add other mfrs when possible)
- add configure rules and a Makefile for easier installation
