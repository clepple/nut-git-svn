Desc: Udev script for NUT USB drivers

This document introduces the Linux udev script for NUT USB
drivers (usbhid-ups, bcmxcp_usb and tripplite_usb).

These are needed on Linux systems running udev (recommended
as of kernel 2.6.3, and mandatory as of 2.6.14 and higher).

This script ensure that the right privileges are set on the
usb devices files to allow the NUT driver to operate (ie
allowing the nut user to read AND write to the UPS device).

Note that the old style hotplug files, available in the
scripts/hotplug directory, are not needed if your kernel supports
udev.

Installation
------------

For most users, these files will be automatically installed in
/etc/udev upon "make install", if that directory exists. You can
specify an alternate directory with ./configure --with-udev-dir=DIR.

Manual installation
-------------------

To install them manually, copy nut-usbups.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d
using the command

$ cp -f nut-usbups.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/52_nut-usbups.rules

You can then plug your UPS USB cord, or unplug / replug it to
refresh the device permission, and start NUT.
