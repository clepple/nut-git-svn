This document introduces the Linux udev script for NUT USB
drivers (usbhid-ups, bcmxcp_usb and tripplite_usb).

These are needed on Linux systems running udev (recommended
as of kernel 2.6.3, and mandatory as of 2.6.14 and higher).

This script ensure that the right privileges are set on the
usb devices files to allow the NUT driver to operate (ie
allowing the nut user to read AND write to the UPS device).

Usage
-----

Copy nut-usbups.rules to /etc/udev/rules using the command

$ cp -f nut-usbups.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/52_nut-usbups.rules

You can then plug your UPS USB cord, or unplug / replug it to
refresh the device permission, and start NUT.

Note that the old style hotplug files, available in the
scripts/hotplug directory, are not needed anymore.

TODO
----
- add configure and Makefile rules for easier installation
