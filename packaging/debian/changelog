  * debian/nut.postinst: fix permissions on /var/lib/nut (closes: Bug#173318)
  * debian/nut.preinst: change how the 'nut' user/group are detected and
    created (closes: Bug#173321)
  * between 1.1.11-1 incorrectly installed conffiles into /etc/nut

    did not migrate to testing and since 1.1.11-2 the .sample extension
    has not been used (closes: Bug#172217)
  * debian/nut.preinst: change the way the nut user/group are detected
    before adduser is called (closes: Bug#170653)

nut (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

    /etc/nut/upsset.conf so that they are world readable (Closes: Bug#167332)
  * debian/nut.init: added sleep 5 to allow for an orderly restart (thanks
    to Shaul Karl for pointing this out)

nut (1.1.12-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release (urgency high due to SECURITY FIX)
  * SECURITY FIX: a file permission problem potentially exposes
    non-system usernames/passwords in /etc/nut/upsd.users that can be used
    to DoS a machine running nut by contacting the nut daemon and instructing
    it to power off the machine; fixed.
  * debian/nut.postinst: change permissions of /etc/nut/upsd.users and
    other conffiles to 640 (Closes: Bug#165445)
  * debian/nut.config: use db_fset to reset the boolean question that prompts
    users to accept whether to continue with the installation of this version
    of nut should they answer no (Closes: Bug#165376)
  * debian/control: make nut-cgi Replace nut so that conflicting files
    can be installed (Closes: Bug#165049)
  * drivers/Makefile.in: restored original version that doesn't build
    hidups, snmp-ups or powernet; hidups doesn't build on m68k; snmp-ups
    and powernet require libsnmp5-dev but libsnmp5-dev requires OpenSSL;
    unfortunately, upstream's license doesn't have the OpenSSL exclusion
    clause... work is proceeding on porting to gnutls
  * drivers/Makefile.in + debian/rules: figured out a mechanism to build
    hidups on those architectures that have /usr/include/linux/hiddev.h
  * debian/control: build-depend on libgd-xpm-dev (really closes Bug#164832)

nut (1.1.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed build dependencies to avoid depending on a pure-virtual package
    without providing a default (thanks Junichi Uekawa) (Closes: Bug#164832)
  * debian/rules calls $(MAKE) install-misc so that the header and the .o file
    are released with the nut package (too small for a nut-dev package?)

 -- Luca Filipozzi <lfilipoz@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Oct 2002 08:50:18 -0700

nut (1.1.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    (Closes: Bug#151047, Bug#155943, Bug#153174, Bug#160178, Bug#164024)
  * the "Hey Dorothy, you aren't in Kansas anymore" release
  * warning: significant changes since nut 0.45.5; specifically:
    - upsd listens on a different port (was 3305; now 3493 (IANA-assigned))
    - configuration file formats have changed
    - ups driver internals haved changed: 'common main.c' + upsdrvctl
    - some ups drivers that were not ported to the new common model have
      been dropped by the upstream author (submit a patch to rectify)
    - the init script is significantly simpler
    - the daemons will NOT restart on upgrade from from 0.45.5 or earlier
    - there is an /etc/default/nut file that defines whether the daemons
      will be started
    - removed nut-doc package... far too small to merit being on its own

nut (0.45.5-rel-3) unstable; urgency=low

nut (0.45.4-rel-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed debian/rules to call install-misc which installs the development

  * modified all the daemon(s)' source code so that they create pidfiles
  * modified the init script so that it uses the pidfiles

nut (0.44.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * the following changes suggested by Patrik Rak (Closes: #77144, #77195)
    * added better preinst(install) checks for group membership
    * modified upstream upsd.conf to use correct paths in the UPS directives
    * modified upstream upsd.conf to have better ACCESS directive examples
    * modified upstream upsmon.conf to have better MONITOR directive examples
    * modified upstream upsmon.conf to use a different POWERDOWNFLAG location
      (location must be on the root filesystem... otherwise powerdownflag is
       not found!)
    * modified init script to parse upsmon.conf for the POWERDOWNFLAG location
    * modified init script's poweroff section so that all args are recognized
    * improved the documentation, primarily README.Debian
  * installation scripts modified so that the dependency on adduser >= 3.14
    can be removed; this allows for the creation of potato packages
  * the nut user is no longer part of the dialout group; users will have to
    manually change the permissions on the serial port devices;
    a nut group is created at the same time as the nut user; users should use
    the nut group for the serial port permissions: chown root.nut /dev/ttyS0
    (suggested by Shaul Karl and Patrik Rak)
  * the cgi scripts are moved to /usr/lib/cgi-bin/nut/*
    (suggested by Shaul Karl)
  * init script changed significantly to address argument passing problems
    (reported by Shaul Karl)

nut (0.44.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
