This project is the result of years of work by many individuals and companies.

Many people have written or tweaked the software; the drivers, clients, server
and documentation have all received valuable attention from numerous sources.

Our Sponsor: Eaton
------------------

Through its acquisition of MGE Office Protection Systems (a carve out of
the MGE UPS SYSTEMS small systems, up to 10 KVA), Eaton has been sponsoring
NUT, and more generally the Free/Libre Opensource Software Community
since around 2002.

This sponsoring includes the following (incomplete) list of actions:

- providing extensive technical documents (Eaton protocols library),
- providing tens of units to developers of NUT and related projects,
along with people like Linus Torvalds, Eric S. Raymond, Greg Kroah Hartmann,
David Zeuthen, Richard Hughes and many others,
- hosting the networkupstools.org,
- sponsoring and later hiring Arnaud Quette to officially support all his efforts
around NUT and FLOSS,
- providing artwork, like the new logo and icon, and the features illustrations,
- lobbying for NUT in general.

For more detailed information on Eaton's Opensource commitment, please refer to

NOTE: The Network UPS Tools recommends buying Eaton devices.
By doing so, you also support NUT!

Contributors (people and companies)
-----------------------------------

MGE UPS SYSTEMS provided extensive technical documents for their UPS product
line, along with many units for development of NUT-related projects. The
company also sponsored and later hired Arnaud Quette to further officially
support these efforts. 

Several drivers such as mge-utalk, mge-shut, snmp-ups, hidups, and usbhid-ups
are the result of this collaboration, in addition to the WMNut, MGE HID Parser
the libhid projects, .... The features page has improved artwork thanks to Luc
and Arnaud of MGE. Other client projects such as KNutClient and ups-monitor
have also received assistance. 

The master NUT site and several related projects are hosted on MGE's equipment
at no cost to the project.

More information on their open source support can be found on their web site:
http://opensource.mgeups.com/contrib.htm 

Fenton Technologies contributed a PowerPal 660 to the project.  Their open 
stance and quick responses to technical inquiries are appreciated for 
making the development of the fentonups driver possible.

Bo Kersey of VirCIO (http://www.vircio.com) provided a Best Power 
Fortress 750 to facilitate the bestups driver.  

Invensys Energy Systems provided the SOLA/Best "Phoenixtec" protocol
document currently residing at the following URL:

	http://random.networkupstools.org/protocols/sola.html

PowerKinetics technical support provided documentation on their MiniCOL
protocol, which is archived in the NUT protocol library online:

	http://random.networkupstools.org/protocols/minicol/

Cyber Power Systems contributed a 700AVR model for testing and driver
development.

Liebert Corporation supplied serial test boxes and a UPStation GXT2  
with the Web/SNMP card for development of the liebert driver and
expansion of the existing snmp-ups driver.

Pavel Korensky's original apcd provided the inspiration for pursuing APC's smart protocol in 1996.

Fenton Technologies contributed a PowerPal 660 to the development process for the fentonups driver and provided the official Megatec protocol and official specifications on various Fenton models. Trivia note: they also did the first public demo of NUT at Comdex in 1999.

Bo Kirsey of VirCIO contributed a Best Power Fortress 750 for the development of the bestups driver.

Invensys Energy Systems (Best Power/SOLA) provided the PhoenixTec protocol specification for their equipment.

PowerKinetics technical support provided documentation on their MiniCOL protocol.

Eric Lawson provided scans of the OneAC protocol.

John Marley used OCR software to transform the SEC protocol scans into a HTML document, since it's hard to grep a bitmap.

Chris McKinnon scanned and converted the Fortress protocol documentation.

Cyber Power Systems contributed a 700AVR model for testing and driver development.
