There are various ways to obtain support for NUT.

Documentation
-------------

- First, be sure to read the link:FAQ.html[FAQ]. The most common problems are already
addressed there.

- Else, you can read the link:user-manual.html[NUT User Manual].
It also covers many areas about installing, configuring and using NUT.
The specific steps on system integration are also discussed.

- Finally, link:man/index.html#User_man[User manual pages] will also
complete the User Manual provided information. At least, read the manual
page related to your driver(s).

Mailing lists
-------------

If you have still not found a solution, you should search the lists before
posting a question.
