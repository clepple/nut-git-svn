Creating new client
===================

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

NUT provides bindings, for several common languages, that are
presented below. All these are released under the same license as
NUT, that is to say the GNU General Public License.

If none of these suits you for technical or legal reasons, you can
implement one easily using the <<net-protocol,Network protocol information>>.

This approach has been used to create the Python 'PyNUT' module, the
Nagios 'check_ups' plugin and probably others, which can serve as a
reference.

C / C++
-------

Client access library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The upsclient library can be linked into other programs to give access
to upsd and UPS status information. Both static and shared versions are provided.

Clients like upsc are provided as examples of how to retrieve data using the
upsclient functions.
link:http://www.networkupstools.org/projects.html[Other programs] not included
in this package may also use this library, such as wmnut.

This library file and the associated header files are not installed by
default.  You must './configure --with-lib' to enable building and
installing these files. The libraries can then be build and installed
with 'make' and 'make install' as usual. This must be done before
building other (non-NUT) programs which depend on them.

For more information, refer to the link:man/upsclient.html[upsclient(3)],
manual page and the various
link:man/index.html#Developer_man[upscli_*(3)] functions documentation
referenced in the same file.

Configuration helpers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NUT provides helper scripts to ease the configuration step of your program, by
detecting the right compilation and link flags:

- one for platform providing pkg-config,
- and the other (libupsclient-config) for platform not providing pkg-config.

Reference: man page: link:man/libupsclient-config.html[libupsclient-config(1)]

Perl

Comment: This binding has recently been updated and integrated into nut.
scripts/perl/Nut.pm contains doc that can be ripped off or auto extracted.
