NAME
----

snmp-ups - Multi-MIB Driver for SNMP UPS equipment

NOTE
----
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
snmp-ups driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

The snmp-ups driver automatically detects and supports a wide range of devices by loading various MIBS:
*ietf*::
UPS that is RFC 1628 (UPS MIB) compliant, e.g. MGE UPS SYSTEMS, Liebert, perhaps others (default)

*mge*::
MGE UPS SYSTEMS and MGE Office Protection Systems devices with SNMP cards (ref 66062, 66045, 66074 and 66244)

*apcc*::
APC AP9606 APC Web/SNMP management card, perhaps others

*netvision*::
Socomec Sicon UPS with Netvision Web/SNMP management card/external box

*pw*::
Powerware devices with ConnectUPS SNMP cards

*aphel_genesisII*::
Eaton Powerware ePDU Monitored

*aphel_revelation*::
Eaton Powerware ePDU Managed

*raritan*::
Various Raritan PDUs

*baytech*::
Various BayTech PDUs

*cpqpower*::
HP/Compaq AF401A management card, perhaps others

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5]:

*mibs*='name'::
Set MIB compliance (default=auto, allowed entries: refer to the above SUPPORTED HARDWARE).
With "auto", the driver will try a select set of SNMP objects until it finds
one that the device responds to.

*community*='name'::
Set community name (default = public).
Note that you require a RW community name to change UPS settings (as for a powerdown).

*snmp_version*='version'::
Set SNMP version (default = v1, the other allowed value is v2c)

*pollfreq*='value'::
Set polling frequency in seconds, to reduce network flow (default=30)

*notransferoids*::
Disable the monitoring of the low and high voltage transfer OIDs in
the hardware.  This will remove input.transfer.low and input.transfer.high
from the list of variables.  This should only be used on APCC Symmetra
equipment which has strangeness in the three-phase power reporting.

*secLevel*='value'::
Set the securityLevel used for SNMPv3 messages (default=noAuthNoPriv,
allowed: authNoPriv,authPriv)

*secName*='value'::
Set the securityName used for authenticated SNMPv3 messages (no default)

*authPassword*='value'::
Set the authentication pass phrase used for authenticated SNMPv3 messages
(no default)

*privPassword*='value'::
Set the privacy pass phrase used for encrypted SNMPv3 messages (no default)

*authProtocol*='value'::
Set the authentication protocol (MD5 or SHA) used for authenticated SNMPv3
messages (default=MD5)

*privProtocol*='value'::
Set the privacy protocol (DES or AES) used for encrypted SNMPv3 messages
(default=DES)

REQUIREMENTS
------------
You will need to install the Net-SNMP package from
http://www.net-snmp.org/ before building this driver.

SNMP v3 also requires OpenSSL support from http://www.openssl.org.

LIMITATION
----------
Shutdown
~~~~~~~~

This driver does not provide a proper upsdrv_shutdown() function. There probably
never will be one, since at the time this script should run (near the end of
the system halt script), there will be no network capabilities anymore.
Probably the only way to shutdown an SNMP UPS is by sending it a shutdown
with delay command through linkman:upscmd[8] and hope for the best that the
system will have finished shutting down before the power is cut.

INSTALLATION
------------
This driver is only built if the Net-SNMP development files are present on the system.
You can also force it to be built by using "configure --with-snmp=yes" before calling make.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------
The hostname of the UPS is specified with the "port" value in
`ups.conf`, i.e.:

	[snmpv1]
		driver = snmp-ups
		port = snmp-ups.example.com
		community = public
		snmp_version = v1
		mibs = ietf
		pollfreq = 15
		desc = "Example SNMP v1 device"

	[snmpv3]
		driver = snmp-ups
		port = 166.99.224.132
		mibs = mge
		secLevel = authPriv
		secName = mysecurityname
		authPassword = myauthenticationpassphrase
		privPassword = myprivatepassphrase
		desc = "Example SNMP v3 device, with the highest security level"
