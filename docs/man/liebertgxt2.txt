LIEBERTGXT2(8)
==============

NAME  
----

liebertgxt2 - Driver for Liebert GXT2 UPS, using the ESP2 serial protocol

NOTE
----
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
liebertgxt2 driver.  For information about the core driver, see  
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------
*liebertgxt2* is experimental and will recognize only those models known to
work. The driver will report the model it finds and abort if it is unknown.
`modelname=` in linkman:ups.conf[5] can be used to force the driver to accept
the model as supported. 

The driver is incomplete but supports the numerious information fields and
fields necessary to make the driver useful. Potentially useful features that
aren't supported are shutdown and battery test - or any command that instructs
the UPS to take some action. 

CABLING
-------

This driver expects to see 2400 baud serial data at the TX/RX pins. This driver
was tested with an original cable.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5]:

*modelname=*'model'::
Force the model name of 'model' to be a supported model, giving you the chance
to try this driver with your Liebert UPS.

BUGS
----
Action commands are not supported, that includes battery test and shutdown.
