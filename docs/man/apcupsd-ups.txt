==============

NAME
----
apcupsd-ups - Driver for apcupsd client access

NOTE
----
This man page only documents the specific features of the
apcupsd-ups driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program is a apcupsd client driver.

*apcupsd-ups* acts as an apcupsd client, simply forwarding data.
This can be useful in cases where both protocols are required in a network
or in case apcupsd has a required UPS access mode missing from NUT.

Port Variable:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Port is the name of a remote host running apcupsd in the form:

	<hostname>[:<port>]

For instance:

    [apcupsd]
		driver = apcupsd-ups
		port = localhost
		desc = "apcupsd client"

BACKGROUND
----------

This driver was written in one evening to allow interworking with apcupsd.

BUGS
----
Access to apcupsd is strictly read only, no commands can be issued.
