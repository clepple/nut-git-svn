UPSD.CONF(5)
============

NAME
----

upsd.conf - Configuration for Network UPS Tools upsd

DESCRIPTION
-----------

upsd uses this file to control access to the server and set some other
miscellaneous configuration values.  This file contains details on
access controls, so keep it secure.  Ideally, only the upsd process
should be able to read it.

CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES
------------------------

"MAXAGE 'seconds'"::

upsd usually allows a driver to stop responding for up to 15 seconds
before declaring the data "stale".  If your driver takes a very long
time to process updates but is otherwise operational, you can use MAXAGE
to make upsd wait longer.
+
Most users should leave this at the default value.

"STATEPATH 'path'"::

Tell upsd to look for the driver state sockets in 'path' rather
than the default that was compiled into the program.

"LISTEN 'interface' 'port'"::

Bind a listening port to the interface specified by its Internet
address.  This may be useful on hosts with multiple interfaces.
You should not rely exclusively on this for security, as it can be
subverted on many systems.
+
Listen on TCP port 'port' instead of the default value which was
compiled into the code.  This overrides any value you may have set
with 'configure --with-port'.  If you don't change it with configure
or this value, upsd will listen on port 3493 for this interface.
+
Multiple LISTEN addresses may be specified.  The default is to bind to
127.0.0.1 if no LISTEN addresses are specified (and ::1 if IPv6 support is
compiled in).

	LISTEN 127.0.0.1
	LISTEN 192.168.50.1
	LISTEN ::1
	LISTEN 2001:0db8:1234:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7344
+
This parameter will only be read at startup.  You'll need to restart
(rather than reload) upsd to apply any changes made here.

"MAXCONN 'connections'"::

This defaults to maximum number allowed on your system.  Each UPS, each
LISTEN address and each client count as one connection.  If the server
runs out of connections, it will no longer accept new incoming client
connections.  Only set this if you know exactly what you're doing.

"CERTFILE 'certificate file'"::

When compiled with SSL support, you can enter the certificate file here.
The certificates must be in PEM format and must be sorted starting with
the subject's certificate (server certificate), followed by intermediate
CA certificates (if applicable_ and the highest level (root) CA. It should
end with the server key. See 'docs/security.txt' or the Security chapter of
NUT user manual for more information on the SSL support in NUT.
