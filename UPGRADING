===============
endif::txt[]

This file lists changes that affect users who installed older versions 
of this software.  When upgrading from an older version, be sure to
check this file to see if you need to make changes to your system.

Changes from 2.6.4 to 2.6.5
---------------------------

- users are encouraged to update to NUT 2.6.5, to fix a regression in
upssched.
- mge-shut driver has been replaced by a new implementation (newmge-shut).
In case of issue with this new version, users can revert to oldmge-shut.

Changes from 2.6.3 to 2.6.4
---------------------------

- users are encouraged to update to NUT 2.6.4, to fix upsd vulnerability
(CVE-2012-2944: upsd can be remotely crashed).
- users of the bestups driver are encouraged to switch to blazer_ser,
since bestups will soon be deprecated.

Changes from 2.6.2 to 2.6.3
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.

Changes from 2.6.1 to 2.6.2
---------------------------

- apcsmart driver has been replaced by a new implementation. In case of issue
with this new version, users can revert to apcsmart-old.

Changes from 2.6.0 to 2.6.1
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.

Changes from 2.4.3 to 2.6.0
---------------------------

- users of the megatec and megatec_usb drivers must respectively switch to
blazer_ser and blazer_usb.
- users of the liebertgxt2 driver are advised that the driver name has changed
to liebert-esp2.

Changes from 2.4.2 to 2.4.3
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.

Changes from 2.4.1 to 2.4.2
---------------------------

- The default subdriver for the blazer_usb driver USB id 06da:0003 has changed.
If you use such a device and it is no longer working with this driver, override
the 'subdriver' default in 'ups.conf' (see man 8 blazer).
- NUT ACL and the allowfrom mechanism has been replaced in 2.4.0 by the LISTEN
directive and tcp-wrappers respectively. This information was missing below, so
a double note has been added.

Changes from 2.4.0 to 2.4.1
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.

Changes from 2.2.2 to 2.4.0
---------------------------

- The nut.conf file has been introduced to standardize startup configuration
across the various systems.
- The cpsups and nitram drivers have been replaced by the powerpanel driver,
and removed from the tree. The cyberpower driver may suffer the same in the
future.
- The al175 and energizerups drivers have been removed from the tree, since
these were tagged broken for a long time.
- Developers of external client application using libupsclient must rename
their "UPSCONN" client structure to "UPSCONN_t".
- The upsd server will now disconnect clients that remain silent for more than
60 seconds.
- The files under scripts/python/client are distributed under GPL 3+, whereas
the rest of the files are distributed under GPL 2+. Refer to COPYING for more
information.
- The generated udev rules file has been renamed with dash only, no underscore
anymore (ie 52-nut-usbups.rules instead of 52_nut-usbups.rules)

Changes from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2
---------------------------

- The configure option "--with-lib" has been replaced by "--with-dev".
This enable the additional build and distribution of the static
version of libupsclient, along with the pkg-config helper and manual
pages. The default configure option is to distribute only the shared
version of libupsclient. This can be overriden by using the
"--disable-shared" configure option (distribute static only binaries).
- The UPS poweroff handling of the usbhid-ups driver has been reworked.
Though regression is not expected, users of this driver are
encouraged to test this feature by calling "upsmon -c fsd" and
report any issue on the NUT mailing lists.

Changes from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.
(The below message is repetead due to previous omission)
- Developers of external client application using libupsclient are
encouraged to rename their "UPSCONN" client structure to "UPSCONN_t"
since the former will disappear by the release of NUT 2.4.

Changes from 2.0.5 to 2.2.0
---------------------------

- users of the newhidups driver are advised that the driver name has changed
to usbhid-ups.
- users of the hidups driver must switch to usbhid-ups.
- users of the following drivers (powermust, blazer, fentonups, mustek,
esupssmart, ippon, sms) must switch to megatec, which replaces
all these drivers.  Please refer to doc/megatec.txt for details.
- users of the mge-shut driver are encouraged to test newmge-shut, which
is an alternate driver scheduled to replace mge-shut,
- users of the cpsups driver are encouraged to switch to powerpanel which
is  scheduled to replace cpsups,
- packagers will have to rework the whole nut packaging due to the
major changes in the build system (completely modified, and now using
automake). Refer to packaging/debian/ for an example of migration.
- specifying '-a <id>' is now mandatory when starting a driver manually,
ie not using upsdrvctl.
- Developers of external client application using libupsclient are
encouraged to rename the "UPSCONN" client structure to "UPSCONN_t"
since the former will disapear by the release of NUT 2.4.

Changes from 2.0.4 to 2.0.5
---------------------------

- users of the newhidups driver: the driver is now more strict about
refusing to connect to unknown devices. If your device was
previously supported, but fails to be recognized now, add
'productid=XXXX' to ups.conf. Please report the device to the NUT
developer's mailing list.

Changes from 2.0.3 to 2.0.4
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.
- users of the following drivers (powermust, blazer, fentonups, mustek,
esupssmart, ippon, sms, masterguard) are encouraged to switch to megatec,
which should replace all these drivers by nut 2.2. For more information,
please refer to doc/megatec.txt

Changes from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.
- hidups users are encouraged to switch to newhidups, as hidups will be
removed by nut 2.2.

Changes from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2
---------------------------

- The newhidups driver, which is the long run USB support approach,
needs hotplug files installed to setup the right permissions on
device file to operate. Check newhidups manual page for more information.

Changes from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1
---------------------------

- The cyberpower1100 driver is now called cpsups since it supports
more than just one model.  If you use this driver, be sure to remove
the old binary and update your ups.conf 'driver=' setting with the
new name.

- The upsstats.html template page has been changed slightly to reflect
better HTML compliance, so you may want to update your installed copy
accordingly.  If you've customized your file, don't just copy the new
one over it, or your changes will be lost!

Changes from 1.4.0 to 2.0.0
---------------------------

- The sample config files are no longer installed by default.  If you
want to install them, use 'make install-conf' for the main programs,
and 'make install-cgi-conf' for the CGI programs.

- ACCESS is no longer supported in upsd.conf.  Use ACCEPT and REJECT.
Old way:

	ACCESS grant all adminbox
	ACCESS grant all webserver
	ACCESS deny all all

New way:

	ACCEPT adminbox
	ACCEPT webserver
	REJECT all

Note that ACCEPT and REJECT can take multiple arguments, so this
will also work:

	ACCEPT adminbox webserver
	REJECT all

- The drivers no longer support sddelay in ups.conf or -d on the
command line.  If you need a delay after calling 'upsdrvctl
shutdown', add a call to sleep in your shutdown script.

- The templates used by upsstats have changed considerably to reflect
the new variable names.  If you use upsstats, you will need to
install new copies or edit your existing files to use the new names.

- Nobody needed UDP mode, so it has been removed.  The only users
seemed to be a few people like me with ancient asapm-ups binaries.
If you really want to run asapm-ups again, bug me for the new patch
which makes it work with upsclient.

- 'make install-misc' is now 'make install-lib'.  The misc directory
has been gone for a long time, and the target was ambiguous.

- The newapc driver has been renamed to apcsmart.  If you previously
used newapc, make sure you delete the old binary and fix your 
ups.conf.  Otherwise, you may run the old driver from 1.4.


*** File trimmed here on changes from 1.2.2 to 1.4.0 ***
